# CodilityTasks
Solutions to some of the Codility training tasks in Swift.

Codility offers great training center for Algorithms - https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/1-iterations/.

The tasks in the project are split the same way as in Codility. 

I highly recommend trying to solve the tasks by yourself, instead of looking at the solutions.

Any feedback is more than welcome. Enjoy.
